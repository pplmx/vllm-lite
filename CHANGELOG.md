## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **MambaBlock Weight Loading**
    - Added `MambaBlock::from_weights` method to load SSM layer weights
    - Implemented full weight loading for Qwen3.5 Mamba models
    - Supports fallback for embed_tokens and lm_head weight names
    - Supports tied embeddings (tie_word_embeddings)

### Refactored

#### Architecture Refactoring

- **Scheduler Module Split**
    - Split monolithic `scheduler.rs` into focused submodules
    - Created `scheduler/queue.rs` with `RequestQueue` for queue management
    - Created `scheduler/preemption.rs` with `PreemptionManager` for preemption decisions
    - Created `scheduler/eviction.rs` with `EvictionPolicy` for block eviction
    - Fully integrated all modules into `Scheduler` struct

- **KV Cache Layer Separation**
    - Split `core/kv_cache.rs` into `kv_cache/block_allocator.rs` and `kv_cache/prefix_cache.rs`
    - Created `model/paged_tensor/` module (separating logical and physical KV cache)
    - `tensor_store.rs` for GPU KV tensor management
    - `quantization.rs` for INT8/FP8 quantization
    - Added deprecated alias in `kv_cache.rs` for backward compatibility

- **Kernel Layer Extraction**
    - Created `model/kernels/` directory for GPU kernels
    - Moved `flash_attention.rs` → `kernels/flash_attention.rs`
    - Moved `fused_kernel.rs` → `kernels/fused_mlp.rs`
    - Moved `cuda_graph.rs` from core to `model/kernels/cuda_graph.rs`
    - Updated `components/` to use kernels module

### Added

#### Phase 4: Performance Optimization

- **Quantization Support**
    - FP16 support
    - INT8 Weight-Only quantization (`QuantizedLinear`, `quantize_2d`)
    - INT8 KV Cache with per-layer scaling
    - QuantizationCalibrator for calibration
- **Compute Optimization**
    - Flash Attention framework with software fallback (`FlashAttention`, `ScaledDotProductAttention`)
    - Sliding window attention support
    - CUDA Graph framework (`CudaGraph`, `CudaGraphExecutor`)
- **Scheduling Optimization**
    - PD Separation (Prefill/Decode separation)
    - Chunked Prefill with configurable chunk size
    - Dynamic Batch Size based on available KV blocks
    - Priority-based scheduling (`Priority`, `enable_priority_scheduling`)
- **Distributed**
    - Multi-GPU Tensor Parallelism (`DeviceMesh`, `ColumnParallelLinear`, `RowParallelLinear`, `AllReduce`)

#### Phase 5: Production Readiness (2025-04-12)

**Observability & Metrics**
- Prometheus-compatible metrics export (`/metrics` endpoint)
- Enhanced metrics collection (CUDA Graph, Sequence Packing, Adaptive Speculative)
- Health check endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`)
- Real-time metrics with `EnhancedMetricsCollector`

**Fault Tolerance**
- Circuit breaker pattern for automatic failure recovery
- Retry strategy with exponential backoff
- Degrade strategy for graceful degradation
- Recovery manager with error severity classification

**Testing**
- 26 E2E integration tests (lifecycle, concurrent, error recovery, graceful shutdown)
- Deterministic mock models for reproducible tests
- Performance regression testing in CI

**Deployment**
- Multi-stage Docker build (`Dockerfile`)
- Docker Compose with Prometheus (`docker-compose.yml`)
- Kubernetes manifests (namespace, deployment, service, HPA)
- CI performance regression workflow (`.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`)

**Core Features**
- Request timeout support (`timeout` parameter)
- Graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM handling)
- YAML configuration file support
- Environment variable overrides (`VLLM_HOST`, `VLLM_PORT`, etc.)
- Structured JSON logging with file rotation
- Grafana dashboard (`docs/grafana/dashboard.json`)
- Config validation on startup
- Error retry support (`retries` parameter)

#### Core Features

- Real-time metrics collection with `/v1/stats` and `/metrics` endpoints
- Quantization utilities (`crates/model/src/quantize.rs`)
- Tiled Attention for memory optimization
- INT8 quantization support in KV Cache
- Forward pass with tiled attention strategy
- Comprehensive test suite for tiled attention
