# Project State

> **Doc navigation:** [`.planning/DOC-MAP.md`](./DOC-MAP.md) — authority matrix for README / docs / planning.

## Current Position

Phase: v31.0 Phase D (Multi-Node)
Plan: `.planning/v31.0-MASTER-PLAN.md`
Status: v30 shipped (CHANGELOG authoritative); v31 in progress
Last activity: 2026-07-12 — Technical due diligence P0 batch:
ARCH-01 (`4a2eaed`), API-01 (`5f232b9`), ARCH-02 (pending commit)
all closed. ARCH-02 closes the seam where the HTTP layer accepted
sampling parameters but the model layer always chose argmax.

## v30 Outcomes (shipped per CHANGELOG)

- Phases 8–19: file splits, YaRN, architecture unification, OPS-05 seams
- Phases K–P: mutation testing, fuzz CI, proptest, docs, ADR, tutorial
- 1235 tests; doc coverage **70.8% raw / 67.4% real** (target 65% real ✅)

## v31 Active Work

- [x] Chunked prefill continuation — all architectures + unit tests
- [x] `docs/architecture.md`, README honesty, OPERATIONS.md, ADR-019
- [x] `.planning/DOC-MAP.md` — doc authority matrix
- [x] Doc coverage 55% → **67.4% real** / 70.8% raw (target 65% real)
- [x] Phase 12e `public-api-check` in CI + baselines refreshed
- [x] **Phase 31-D KV block transfer (OPS-31d)** — `TransferKVBlock` gRPC RPC, `BlockDataSource` trait, `DistributedKVCache::fetch_block` fan-out, 64 MiB symmetric message limit. Test count: vllm-dist 64 → 87 (+23); workspace 1307 → 1338 (+31). Phase plan: `.planning/phase-19/ops-31d-kv-block-transfer.md`.

## Technical Due Diligence — closed items

Closed seven items from `docs/technical-due-diligence/` across three
sessions. Each PR is self-contained and carries the issue ID +
doc reference in its commit message.

### P0 (closed)

- [x] **REL-01** (`0f3f9db`) — engine mailbox now bounded
  (`engine_mailbox_capacity`, default 256). Saturated mailbox
  surfaces as `503 engine_overloaded` (distinct from
  `engine_unavailable`). New `crates/server/tests/overload_integration.rs`
  covers Full / Closed / under-capacity.
- [x] **OBS-01** (`32b1f71`) — `/metrics` now reads from
  `engine.scheduler.metrics` instead of a freshly constructed
  duplicate collector. New `crates/server/tests/metrics_wiring.rs`
  guards the Arc-sharing invariant.
- [x] **DEP-01** (`3dcec01`) — Dockerfile bumped to MSRV 1.88 +
  `--locked` + named `runtime` stage + curl-based HEALTHCHECK;
  docker-compose points at real paths and emits `VLLM_*` env vars;
  Helm chart emits `VLLM_MODEL` / `VLLM_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` /
  `VLLM_KV_BLOCKS` / `VLLM_TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE`. New
  `scripts/smoke-deployment.sh` re-checks every change in CI.
  Added `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- [x] **SEC-01** (`3b97440`) — `/debug/*` and `/shutdown` now
  require admin auth (valid Bearer when keys configured; 503
  `admin_disabled` when none configured). Startup logs a loud
  warning when binding to a non-loopback address without auth.
  New `--insecure-allow-public-no-auth` escape hatch. 9 new
  integration tests in `crates/server/tests/admin_gating.rs`.
- [x] **ARCH-01** (`4a2eaed`) — prefix-cache shared-block
  refcount is now wired through `EvictionPolicy::release_blocks`
  (returns the freed set) → `MemoryManager::release_blocks`
  (only frees what the policy says) → `SchedulerEngine::add_request`
  (records on cache hit) and `SchedulerEngine::update`
  (records on allocation and on cache insert). Cancel and
  preemption paths benefit automatically. New
  `crates/core/tests/prefix_cache_refcount.rs` covers three
  regressions: cache-hit returns same block IDs, outstanding
  refcount prevents free, unrecorded-block release still frees.
- [x] **ARCH-02** (pending commit) — `SamplingParams` moved from
  `vllm_core::types` to `vllm_traits::sampling` so the wire-format
  `Batch` can carry a per-sequence `Vec<SamplingParams>` without a
  cyclic dependency. `BatchComposer::{decode,prefill,chunked}`
  populate the field from `Sequence::sampling_params`.
  `Engine::step_regular` and `engine::graph_step::execute_regular`
  switched from `model.forward` (greedy internally) to
  `model.forward_logits` + the new
  `sampling::sample_batch_with_params`. Repeat penalty uses
  `seq.tokens[prompt_len..]` as the seen-set so generated tokens
  are penalised. `StubModel::forward_logits` updated to honour
  the configured `return_token` so engine tests still observe
  deterministic tokens. New regression test
  `crates/core/tests/sampling_params.rs` covers greedy per-seq
  argmax, explicit `top_k=1`, and `repeat_penalty` flipping the
  argmax on the second decode step.

### P1 (closed)

- [x] **API-01** (`5f232b9`) — Batch API `/v1/batches` create
  handler now returns `501 Not Implemented` with a
  documentation-referencing error code instead of persisting a
  job that no worker would advance. Read endpoints remain
  functional for inspecting legacy jobs.

## Deferred Items (v32+)

- **PERF-01** (continuous batching kernel) — very-high complexity;
  blocked on a stable KernelBackend seam.
- **CI-01** (GPU/real-weight CI) — needs a runner with a GPU
  and a checkpoint cache.
- **GOV-01** (version unification) — workspace version, image
  tag, Helm appVersion, and CHANGELOG all need to derive from a
  single release manifest.
